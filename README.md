# Traffic_Sign_Detection
This project uses the YOLOv8 object detection model to identify and classify 21 types of traffic signs in both images and videos. A user-friendly interface is built using Streamlit for easy uploads and real-time detection. The model achieves 91.7% mAP@0.5 and 90.3% recall, making it highly accurate for road sign recognition.
It supports real-time video processing and single/multiple image detection.
Ideal for applications in autonomous driving systems and smart traffic surveillance.
